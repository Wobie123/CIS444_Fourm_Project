        <p>I'm taking calculus for the first time this year, and I was amazed when I first did an integral and the correct answer popped out. Somehow a bunch of scribbles on paper added up an infinite sum of infinitely small pieces of a weird shape to get a perfect number. I guess what I am asking is when someone uses the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to do an integral, where exactly is the "infiniteness" happening? What is happening on some level that allows it to work?</p>

        <p>The derivative of the integral of a function would represent how fast the area grows as x grows. If the original function f(x) is a constant k you can see that the area is simply growing linearly as x increases because it is dx*k. So how fast the area is growing is just the output of the original function.....</p>

        <p>There is a pretty easy way to understand why it works. In one short phrase, it is that "the derivative of the area function is the function you started with......</p>
